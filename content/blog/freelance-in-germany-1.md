[A friend and former colleague of mine](https://www.linkedin.com/in/oleksandr-p-600b091b8/) was interested to know more about my freelancing journey.
The conversation started like this:
> I wonder what the process looks like? Is there a common thing like LinkedIn for freelancers or does everyone just use LinkedIn to connect?
> **"Nokia, connecting people!"** ðŸ˜‚

So it was time to make a blog post about it...

## Finding a tax advisor

Took me like 3 weeks to find one due to the "[Grundsteuer](https://www.grundsteuer.bayern.de/)" wave going on in Germany.
I called a dozen, sent emails to another dozen, and either got no reply, or plainly "I am sorry, we are currently not receiving new customers" ðŸ˜­.
Luckily, in _Steuerberaterkammer MÃ¼nchen_'s website, there's a [provided list](https://www.steuerberaterkammer-muenchen.de/de/aktuelles/neues_von_der_kammer/neues_von_der_kammer/kontaktliste_freie_kapazit%C3%A4ten_neue_mandate/index_ger.html) of available tax advisors that you can contact, looking for new customers (a.k.a. neue Mandate).

## Register yourself at the financial office (Finanzamt) as a freelancer

It has nothing to do with immigration, but with taxes.
This is mandatory, and usually takes 2 months to get processed. 

Of course, as an non-EU migrant, one's gotta have something like a _Niederlassungserlaubnis_ (permananent residency) or somehow the blessings from the _AuslÃ¤nderbehÃ¶rde_ to be able to legally work as a freelancer in Germany.
Beware then that, without the proper work authorization, unfortunately you cannot work as a freelancer as a non-EU citizen.

Paperwork is relatively easy to fill by oneself since there's tons of info on the internet.
This form is called _Fragebogen zur steuerlichen Erfassung fÃ¼r Einzelunternehmen_. 

[Here's a very useful guide ](https://allaboutberlin.com/guides/fragebogen-zur-steuerlichen-erfassung)for understanding how to fill the form.
However, it is greatly encouraged to get a tax advisor to help with it. He helped me to get some numbers right. 
The most important one is to calculate how much you are gonna earn in your first and second year. 
The tax office asks for this, since one's gotta pay taxes in advance. 

Once's this is done, you get two new tax numbers (one for making invoices for VAT, another for identifying as freelancer for end of year income declarations).
From there on, one can start charging customers appropriately, using the newly received VAT number on your own invoices.

## Things to do in between
- **To start "networking"**. Going to meetups, conferences, on LinkedIn, etc. Making your own talks, maybe? Just talking about things you enjoy doing will help you find the right folks to network with. Freelancers are usually very friendly, and will not hesitate to connect.
- **Post your profile on websites**. mostly dedicated to freelance in the DACH region. _freelancermap.de, freelance.de, gulp.de, malt.de_ are just a few of them.
- **Prepare a new "landing page"**. This is your "face" towards future customers to get to know you, your passions, ambitions. Your goals reflect what they will get from you. 
- **Choose and setup a booking system.** _papierkram.de_, _lexoffice.de_ are two examples of SaaS that offers this services and more (like contract templates and such).
- (Maybe optional) **Prepare contract templates with a lawyer.** Fully recommended. It helps a lot to understand the extent of liabilities and one's limitations, rights and privileges.
- **Setup new business email(s) and public internet domains.** To define a new domain is tricky. It must be clear and easy for customers to remember.
- **Get certificates done.** It will help to attract new customers, and predefine what you can/cannot do. Beware, this might box you out, but that's something we can discuss on a different blog post.
- **Get new telephone number.** Not really mandatory however if you overshare it, beware you might get scams calls/emails.
- **[EXTREMELY IMPORTANT] Get a business insurance!** I won't make any recommendations on exactly which one to get, however as a software developer, one that additionaly covers cybersec attacks on cloud is very useful.
- **Get a business bank account.** Mandatory by Finanzamt. I have mixed experiences on getting one. I applied to one bank I am customer of, they rejected me after 3 weeks. I applied to another one, I was approved in 5 mins. Crazy world.
- **Other optional stuff** Getting on social media (a mastodon account, ideally), security-related tokens, etc etc etc... list can go on and on.

By the way, everything a software developer does in Europe must be complaint with GDPR, otherwise one might get a hefty fine.
Reading and informing oneself about it is a MUST. Freelancing or not.

## What to charge: the biggest question
Talking to other freelancers in my network, plus taking into account one's own experience/technical skills, might help to estimate how much to charge.
That number might vary, depending on many factors. Unfortunately I cannot discuss much until I have more years on my shoulders, so stay tuned for my next year's bilanz!
One useful advice though: From this number, one has to make sure to pay for one's vacation, sick days, lack of continuous work, etc. Everything must be taken into account.

## Fake freelancing: what's that?
One very important point in Germany about freelancing.
A word one must never forget: _**ScheinselbststÃ¤ndigkeit**_.
Getting advice from your tax advisor about this topic is highly recommended. Rule of thumb tho, a freelancer should be able to work for multiple customers. Maintaining ones "freedom" is important, such as choosing place to work, working hours, amount of customers, ways of working.
Otherwise, the finance office will see that relationship as a "fake freelancing", meaning the employer might need to pay a fine for not hiring the freelancer on a full time basis, to avoid paying for their social contributions (and taxes, of course).
You can find more about this topic on the internet (and [the law!](https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/)) because it is a very extensive topic. 


## All in all...
This is definitely a new game I am playing, and I am quite excited about it. I have a lot of time for learning and doing what I like. Also, I want to learn how to be an entrepreneur and see my options for the future.

This is the first post about freelancing, of the many I intend to post. 
I hope it brings a lot of insight for others looking to tentatively jump on this path too.
