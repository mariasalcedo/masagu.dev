Blabla first summary, Blabla first summary, Blabla first summary, Blabla first summary. And a longer paragraph is more interesting? Maybe, who knows... Let's see.
`this` may work?
Because bla bla, therefore bla bla. Read for more.
<!--more-->
And a code section:

```kotlin
void fun getMane(){
    var mane = "I like Kotlin";
}
```
Then wrap. 
Blabla rest of it
