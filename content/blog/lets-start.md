After fighting my way through stylesheets, and creating my own Hugo Template, I am finally inaugurating this blog! ðŸŽ‰
The main purpose of it, is to share my freelance anecdotes, as well as topics I discover along the way.
Speaking of which...

<!--more-->

The technologies I discovered by bringing this website up and running are:
## [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/)
Hugo is an open source static website templating/generator tool, running under golang (cool, isn't it?).
It has a huge community behind the scenes, which made it the perfect candidate to kickstart my website/blog, building myself a custom template. 
In the near future, I'd like to make it available as a rightful template for everyone to use.

A brownie point is, having full control of your sources, one can stay compliant with EU GDPR guidelines. Meaning: no Javascript nor cookies are stealing data from you while surfing through my domain.

## [SaaS](https://sass-lang.com/)

AND... what about Saas?! Oh lord! This was indeed a great discovery.
In short, it is CSS but on steroids.
This makes stylesheets far less painful for Backend folks like me.

## Some <sub><sub><sub><sub>very basic</sub></sub></sub></sub> javascript

Not that I have discovered javascript.
However the two javascript snippets I've included, which are for toggle dark mode and the impressum buttons, made me rediscover what the backend world made me forget.

## [Giscus](https://github.com/giscus/giscus/)

Additionally, I have enabled a comments section using [Giscus](https://github.com/giscus/giscus/), which is linked to [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/mariasalcedo/masagu.dev/discussions/categories/blog-discussions) where this website repository is located at.
This is indeed super useful when the website source code AND comments can be located at the same place, and one gets notifications when someone left a comment while... working? ^_^U

Anyways, That's all for now. 
I look forward to your comments :)
